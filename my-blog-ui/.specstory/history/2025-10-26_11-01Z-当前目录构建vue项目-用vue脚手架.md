+ ### 路由配置
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/router/index.ts
+ import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
+ import { useUserStore } from '@/stores/user'
+ 
+ const routes = [

+     next('/')
+   } else {
+     next()
+   }
+ })
+ 
+ export default router
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 状态管理设计
+ 
+ ### 1. User Store（用户状态）
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/stores/user.ts
+ import { defineStore } from 'pinia'
+ import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
+ import { userApi } from '@/api/user'
+ import type { UserInfo, LoginForm, RegisterForm } from '@/types/user'
+ 
+ export const useUserStore = defineStore('user', () => {
+   const token = ref<string | null>(localStorage.getItem('token'))
+   const userInfo = ref<UserInfo | null>(null)
+   
+   const isAuthenticated = computed(() => !!token.value)
+   
+   async function login(form: LoginForm) {
+     const response = await userApi.login(form)
+     token.value = response.data.token
+     localStorage.setItem('token', token.value)
+     await getUserInfo()
+     return response
+   }
+   
+   async function register(form: RegisterForm) {
+     const response = await userApi.register(form)
+     return response
+   }
+   
+   async function getUserInfo() {
+     const response = await userApi.getUserInfo()
+     userInfo.value = response.data
+     return response.data
+   }
+   
+   function logout() {
+     token.value = null
+     userInfo.value = null
+     localStorage.removeItem('token')
+   }
+   
+   return {
+     token,
+     userInfo,
+     isAuthenticated,
+     login,
+     register,
+     getUserInfo,
+     logout
+   }
+ })
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 2. Document Store（文档状态）
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/stores/document.ts
+ import { defineStore } from 'pinia'
+ import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
+ import { documentApi } from '@/api/document'
+ import type { Document, DocumentListResponse } from '@/types/document'

+     fetchDocumentById,
+     uploadDocument,
+     updateDocument,
+     deleteDocument
+   }
+ })
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 3. Category Store（分类状态）
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/stores/category.ts
+ import { defineStore } from 'pinia'
+ import { ref } from 'vue'
+ import { categoryApi } from '@/api/category'
+ import type { Category } from '@/types/category'

+       categories.value = response.data
+     } finally {
+       loading.value = false
+     }
+   }
+   
+   async function createCategory(data: Partial<Category>) {
+     loading.value = true
+     try {
+       await categoryApi.create(data)
+       await fetchCategories()

+   async function deleteCategory(id: number) {
+     loading.value = true
+     try {
+       await categoryApi.delete(id)
+       await fetchCategories()
+     } finally {
+       loading.value = false
+     }
+   }
+   
+   return {
+     categories,
+     loading,
+     fetchCategories,
+     createCategory,
+     updateCategory,
+     deleteCategory
+   }
+ })
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 4. Search Store（搜索状态）
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/stores/search.ts
+ import { defineStore } from 'pinia'
+ import { ref } from 'vue'
+ import { searchApi } from '@/api/search'
+ import type { Document, SearchResponse } from '@/types/document'

+   const loading = ref(false)
+   
+   async function search(searchKeyword: string) {
+     keyword.value = searchKeyword
+     page.value = 1
+     loading.value = true
+     try {
+       const response: SearchResponse = await searchApi.search(keyword.value, page.value, pageSize.value)
+       results.value = response.data.documents
+       total.value = response.data.total
+     } finally {
+       loading.value = false
+     }
+   }
+   
+   async function loadMore() {
+     page.value++
+     loading.value = true
+     try {

+     }
+   }
+   
+   return {
+     results,
+     keyword,
+     total,
+     page,
+     pageSize,
+     loading,
+     search,
+     loadMore
+   }
+ })
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 组件拆分方案
+ 
+ ### 布局组件
+ 
+ #### 1. AppLayout（主布局）
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <template>
+   <el-container class="app-layout">

+ import Sidebar from '@/components/layout/Sidebar.vue'
+ </script>
+ ```
+ 
+ #### 2. Header（顶部导航）

+         <span>{{ userInfo?.username }}</span>
+         <template #dropdown>
+           <el-dropdown-menu>
+             <el-dropdown-item @click="logout">退出</el-dropdown-item>
+           </el-dropdown-menu>
+         </template>
+       </el-dropdown>
+     </div>
+   </div>
+ </template>
+ 
+ <script setup lang="ts">
+ import { useUserStore } from '@/stores/user'

+ 
+ const userStore = useUserStore()
+ const userInfo = computed(() => userStore.userInfo)
+ 
+ function logout() {
+   userStore.logout()
+   router.push('/login')
+ }
+ </script>
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 文档组件
+ 
+ #### 3. DocumentCard（文档卡片）
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <!-- src/components/document/DocumentCard.vue -->
+ <template>
+   <el-card class="document-card" shadow="hover">
+     <div class="document-info">
+       <h3>{{ document.title }}</h3>
+       <p>{{ document.description }}</p>
+       <div class="meta">
+         <span>分类: {{ categoryName }}</span>
+         <span>大小: {{ formatFileSize(document.fileSize) }}</span>
+         <span>上传时间: {{ formatDate(document.createdAt) }}</span>
+       </div>
+     </div>
+     <div class="document-actions">
+       <el-button @click="viewDocument">查看</el-button>
+       <el-button @click="editDocument">编辑</el-button>
+       <el-button type="danger" @click="deleteDocument">删除</el-button>
+     </div>
+   </el-card>
+ </template>
+ 
+ <script setup lang="ts">
+ import { defineProps, defineEmits, computed } from 'vue'
+ import type { Document } from '@/types/document'
+ 
+ const props = defineProps<{
+   document: Document
+ }>()
+ 
+ const emit = defineEmits(['view', 'edit', 'delete'])
+ </script>
+ ```
+ 
+ #### 4. DocumentUpload（文档上传）
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <!-- src/components/document/DocumentUpload.vue -->
+ <template>
+   <el-card>
+     <el-form :model="form" label-width="100px">
+       <el-form-item label="文件" required>
+         <el-upload
+           :auto-upload="false"
+           :limit="1"
+           :on-change="handleFileChange"
+           :accept=".pdf,.docx,.doc,.txt"
+         >
+           <el-button>选择文件</el-button>
+         </el-upload>
+         <div v-if="file">已选择: {{ file.name }}</div>
+       </el-form-item>
+       <el-form-item label="标题" required>
+         <el-input v-model="form.title" />
+       </el-form-item>
+       <el-form-item label="描述">
+         <el-input v-model="form.description" type="textarea" />
+       </el-form-item>
+       <el-form-item label="分类">
+         <CategorySelect v-model="form.categoryId" />
+       </el-form-item>
+       <el-form-item>
+         <el-button type="primary" @click="handleUpload" :loading="loading">上传</el-button>
+       </el-form-item>
+     </el-form>
+   </el-card>
+ </template>
+ 
+ <script setup lang="ts">
+ import { ref } from 'vue'
+ import { useDocumentStore } from '@/stores/document'
+ import CategorySelect from '@/components/category/CategorySelect.vue'
+ 
+ const documentStore = useDocumentStore()
+ const loading = computed(() => documentStore.loading)
+ </script>
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## API 接口对接
+ 
+ ### 1. Axios 配置
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/api/request.ts
+ import axios from 'axios'
+ import type { AxiosResponse, InternalAxiosRequestConfig } from 'axios'
+ import { ElMessage } from 'element-plus'
+ import { useRouter } from 'vue-router'
+ 
+ interface ApiResponse<T = any> {
+   code: number
+   message: string
+   data: T
+ }
+ 
+ const request = axios.create({
+   baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1',
+   timeout: 30000
+ })
+ 
+ // 请求拦截器
+ request.interceptors.request.use(
+   (config: InternalAxiosRequestConfig) => {
+     const token = localStorage.getItem('token')
+     if (token) {
+       config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`
+     }
+     return config
+   },
+   error => {
+     return Promise.reject(error)
+   }
+ )
+ 
+ // 响应拦截器
+ request.interceptors.response.use(
+   (response: AxiosResponse<ApiResponse>) => {
+     const { code, message, data } = response.data
+     
+     if (code !== 200) {
+       ElMessage.error(message || '请求失败')
+       return Promise.reject(new Error(message))
+     }
+     
+     return response.data
+   },
+   error => {
+     if (error.response?.status === 401) {
+       ElMessage.error('登录已过期，请重新登录')
+       localStorage.removeItem('token')
+       window.location.href = '/login'
+     } else {
+       ElMessage.error(error.response?.data?.message || '网络错误')
+     }
+     return Promise.reject(error)
+   }
+ )
+ 
+ export default request
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 2. API 方法封装
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/api/user.ts
+ import request from './request'
+ import type { LoginForm, RegisterForm, UserInfo, LoginResponse } from '@/types/user'
+ 
+ export const userApi = {
+   // 注册
+   register(data: RegisterForm) {
+     return request.post<ApiResponse<UserInfo>>('/users/register', data)
+   },
+   
+   // 登录
+   login(data: LoginForm) {
+     return request.post<ApiResponse<LoginResponse>>('/users/login', data)
+   },
+   
+   // 获取用户信息
+   getUserInfo() {
+     return request.get<ApiResponse<UserInfo>>('/users/info')
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 3. TypeScript 类型定义
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/types/user.ts
+ export interface LoginForm {
+   username: string
+   password: string
+ }
+ 
+ export interface RegisterForm {
+   username: string
+   password: string
+   email: string
+ }
+ 
+ export interface UserInfo {
+   id: number
+   username: string
+   email: string
+   avatar?: string
+   createdAt: string
+ }
+ 
+ export interface LoginResponse {
+   token: string
+   expiresIn: number
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/types/document.ts
+ export interface Document {
+   id: number
+   title: string
+   description: string
+   fileName: string
+   fileOriginalName: string
+   fileUrl: string
+   fileType: string
+   fileSize: number
+   thumbnail?: string
+   categoryId?: number
+   viewCount: number
+   downloadCount: number
+   createdAt: string
+   updatedAt: string
+ }
+ 
+ export interface DocumentListResponse {
+   total: number
+   page: number
+   pageSize: number
+   documents: Document[]
+ }
+ 
+ export interface SearchResponse {
+   total: number
+   page: number
+   pageSize: number
+   keyword: string
+   documents: Document[]
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 关键交互逻辑
+ 
+ ### 1. 页面初始化
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <script setup lang="ts">
+ import { onMounted } from 'vue'
+ import { useDocumentStore } from '@/stores/document'
+ 
+ const documentStore = useDocumentStore()
+ 
+ onMounted(() => {
+   documentStore.fetchDocuments()
+ })
+ </script>
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 2. 错误处理
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ async function handleUpload() {
+   try {
+     await documentStore.uploadDocument(formData)
+     ElMessage.success('上传成功')
+   } catch (error: any) {
+     if (error.code === 2004) {
+       ElMessage.error('文件大小超限（最大100MB）')
+     } else if (error.code === 2003) {
+       ElMessage.error('不支持的文件类型')
+     } else {
+       ElMessage.error('上传失败，请重试')
+     }
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 3. 加载状态（骨架屏）
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <template>
+   <div v-loading="loading" element-loading-text="加载中...">
+     <el-skeleton v-if="loading" :rows="5" animated />
+     <div v-else>
+       <!-- 内容 -->
+     </div>
+   </div>
+ </template>
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 4. 图片懒加载
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <img
+   v-lazy="document.thumbnail"
+   :key="document.id"
+   alt="文档缩略图"
+ />
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 5. 防抖搜索
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'
+ 
+ const handleSearch = debounce((keyword: string) => {
+   searchStore.search(keyword)
+ }, 500)
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 响应式与可访问性
+ 
+ ### 1. 移动端适配
+ 
+ ```scss
+ // 使用 CSS Grid + Flex + 媒体查询
+ .document-list {
+   display: grid;
+   grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
+   gap: 20px;
+   
+   @media (max-width: 768px) {
+     grid-template-columns: 1fr;
+     gap: 15px;
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 2. ARIA 标签
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <el-button
+   aria-label="上传文档"
+   @click="upload"
+ >
+   上传文档
+ </el-button>
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 3. 键盘导航
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <el-button
+   @click="handleAction"
+   @keyup.enter="handleAction"
+   tabindex="0"
+ >
+   操作
+ </el-button>
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 性能优化方案
+ 
+ ### 1. 路由懒加载
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ const routes = [
+   {
+     path: '/documents/:id',
+     component: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "document-detail" */ '@/views/document/DocumentDetail.vue')
+   }
+ ]
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 2. 组件懒加载
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <script setup lang="ts">
+ import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'
+ 
+ const DocumentDetail = defineAsyncComponent(() => import('@/views/document/DocumentDetail.vue'))
+ </script>
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 3. 图片压缩与 CDN
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // 使用 CDN 配置
+ const CDN_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_CDN_URL
+ 
+ function getImageUrl(path: string): string {
+   return `${CDN_BASE_URL}/${path}?quality=80&format=webp`
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 4. 虚拟滚动（长列表优化）
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <el-virtual-list
+   :data="documents"
+   :item-size="100"
+   height="600px"
+ >
+   <template #default="{ item }">
+     <DocumentCard :document="item" />
+   </template>
+ </el-virtual-list>
+ ```
+ 
+ ---

尝试将 `.project` 目录下的 docx 文件转为 md，先检查是否已安装 Python：


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
python --version
```

```
PS D:\Desktop\study_record\github\blog\my-blog-ui> python --version
Python 3.13.5
PS D:\Desktop\study_record\github\blog\my-blog-ui>

+ 
+ ### 5.3 通用组件
+ 
+ #### SearchBar.vue（搜索框）
+ 
+ ```vue
+ <template>
+   <div class="search-bar">

+     router.push({ path: '/search', query: { keyword: keyword.value } })
+   }
+ }
+ </script>
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 6. 状态管理设计
+ 
+ ### 6.1 Pinia Store 架构
+ 
+ ```
+ stores/
+ ├── index.ts           # Pinia 实例导出
+ ├── user.ts           # 用户状态管理
+ ├── document.ts       # 文档状态管理
+ ├── category.ts       # 分类状态管理
+ └── search.ts         # 搜索状态管理
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 6.2 Store 详细设计
+ 
+ #### User Store（用户状态）
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // stores/user.ts
+ import { defineStore } from 'pinia'
+ import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
+ import { userApi } from '@/api/user'
+ import type { UserInfo, LoginForm, RegisterForm } from '@/types/user'
+ 
+ export const useUserStore = defineStore('user', () => {
+   const token = ref<string | null>(localStorage.getItem('token'))
+   const userInfo = ref<UserInfo | null>(null)
+   const loading = ref(false)
+   
+   const isAuthenticated = computed(() => !!token.value)
+   
+   async function login(credentials: LoginForm) {
+     loading.value = true
+     try {
+       const response = await userApi.login(credentials)
+       token.value = response.data.token
+       localStorage.setItem('token', token.value)
+       await getUserInfo()
+       return response
+     } finally {
+       loading.value = false
+     }
+   }
+   
+   async function register(data: RegisterForm) {
+     loading.value = true
+     try {
+       return await userApi.register(data)
+     } finally {
+       loading.value = false
+     }
+   }
+   
+   async function getUserInfo() {
+     if (!token.value) return null
+     
+     loading.value = true
+     try {
+       const response = await userApi.getUserInfo()
+       userInfo.value = response.data
+       return response.data
+     } finally {
+       loading.value = false
+     }
+   }
+   
+   function logout() {
+     token.value = null
+     userInfo.value = null
+     localStorage.removeItem('token')
+   }
+   
+   return {
+     token,
+     userInfo,
+     loading,
+     isAuthenticated,
+     login,
+     register,
+     getUserInfo,
+     logout
+   }
+ })
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 7. API 接口对接方案
+ 
+ ### 7.1 Axios 配置
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/api/request.ts
+ import axios from 'axios'
+ import type { AxiosResponse, InternalAxiosRequestConfig } from 'axios'
+ import { ElMessage } from 'element-plus'
+ import router from '@/router'
+ 
+ interface ApiResponse<T = any> {
+   code: number
+   message: string
+   data: T
+ }
+ 
+ const request = axios.create({
+   baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1',
+   timeout: 30000
+ })
+ 
+ // 请求拦截器
+ request.interceptors.request.use(
+   (config: InternalAxiosRequestConfig) => {
+     const token = localStorage.getItem('token')
+     if (token) {
+       config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`
+     }
+     return config
+   },
+   error => {
+     return Promise.reject(error)
+   }
+ )
+ 
+ // 响应拦截器
+ request.interceptors.response.use(
+   (response: AxiosResponse<ApiResponse>) => {
+     const { code, message, data } = response.data
+     
+     if (code !== 200) {
+       ElMessage.error(message || '请求失败')
+       return Promise.reject(new Error(message))
+     }
+     
+     return response.data
+   },
+   error => {
+     if (error.response?.status === 401) {
+       ElMessage.error('登录已过期，请重新登录')
+       localStorage.removeItem('token')
+       router.push('/login')
+     } else {
+       ElMessage.error(error.response?.data?.message || '网络错误')
+     }
+     return Promise.reject(error)
+   }
+ )
+ 
+ export default request
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 7.2 API 方法封装
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // src/api/document.ts
+ import request from './request'
+ import type { Document, DocumentListResponse } from '@/types/document'
+ 
+ export const documentApi = {
+   // 上传文档
+   upload(formData: FormData) {
+     return request.post<ApiResponse<Document>>('/documents/upload', formData, {
+       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }
+     })
+   },
+   
+   // 获取文档列表
+   getList(page = 1, pageSize = 10) {
+     return request.get<DocumentListResponse>(`/documents?page=${page}&pageSize=${pageSize}`)
+   },
+   
+   // 获取文档详情
+   getById(id: number) {
+     return request.get<Document>(`/documents/${id}`)
+   },
+   
+   // 更新文档
+   update(id: number, data: Partial<Document>) {
+     return request.put<Document>(`/documents/${id}`, data)
+   },
+   
+   // 删除文档
+   delete(id: number) {
+     return request.delete(`/documents/${id}`)
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 8. UI/UX 设计规范

+   .app-container {
+     .sidebar {
+       display: none;
+     }
+

+ ## 10. 技术实现细节
+ 
+ ### 10.1 文件上传实现
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // components/document/DocumentUpload.vue
+ async function handleUpload() {
+   // 1. 验证文件类型
+   const allowedTypes = ['.pdf', '.docx', '.doc', '.txt']
+   if (!allowedTypes.some(type => file.name.endsWith(type))) {
+     ElMessage.error('不支持的文件类型')
+     return
+   }
+   
+   // 2. 验证文件大小（100MB）
+   const maxSize = 100 * 1024 * 1024
+   if (file.size > maxSize) {
+     ElMessage.error('文件大小不能超过100MB')
+     return
+   }
+   
+   // 3. 创建 FormData
+   const formData = new FormData()
+   formData.append('file', file)
+   formData.append('title', form.title)
+   formData.append('description', form.description)
+   if (form.categoryId) {
+     formData.append('categoryId', form.categoryId.toString())
+   }
+   
+   // 4. 上传文件（带进度条）
+   loading.value = true
+   try {
+     await documentStore.uploadDocument(formData)
+     ElMessage.success('上传成功')
+     router.push('/')
+   } catch (error) {
+     ElMessage.error('上传失败')
+   } finally {
+     loading.value = false
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 10.2 防抖搜索实现
+ 
+ ```typescript

+ 
+ const handleSearch = debounce((keyword: string) => {
+   if (keyword.trim()) {
+     searchStore.search(keyword)
+   } else {
+     searchStore.results = []
+   }
+ }, 500)
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 10.3 路由守卫实现
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
+   const userStore = useUserStore()
+   
+   // 需要认证的页面
+   if (to.meta.requiresAuth && !userStore.isAuthenticated) {
+     next({ name: 'Login', query: { redirect: to.fullPath } })
+     return
+   }
+   
+   // 已登录用户访问登录页
+   if (to.name === 'Login' && userStore.isAuthenticated) {
+     next('/')
+     return
+   }
+   
+   next()
+ })
+ ```

## Phase 1 完成：项目初始化

### 已完成的工作
1. **安装依赖**
   - Vue Router 4
   - Pinia
   - Element Plus
   - Axios
   - Element Plus Icons
2. **项目结构**
   - `src/stores`
   - `src/api`
   - `src/views`
   - `src/components/layout`
   - `src/components/common`
   - `src/utils`
   - `src/types`
   - `src/router`
3. **配置**
   - 在 `main.js` 配置 Pinia、Element Plus、Router
   - 在 `vue.config.js` 配置路径别名 `@`
   - 创建基础路由和视图
4. **验证**
   - 开发服务器运行在 `http://localhost:8080`

### 访问地址
打开浏览器访问：`http://localhost:8080`

页面应显示“欢迎使用个人博客系统”的内容，包含 Phase 1 完成状态的标签。

## 下一步：Phase 2 - 认证功能

开始实现用户登录与注册：
1. 创建 Login 页面
2. 创建 Register 页面
3. 实现 User Store（状态管理）
4. 配置 Axios 与拦截器
5. 添加路由守卫
6. 测试登录与注册功能

需要我现在实现 Phase 2 的认证功能吗？

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [x] Phase 1: 安装必要依赖（Vue Router, Pinia, Element Plus, Axios）
- [x] Phase 1: 配置 TypeScript 和项目结构
- [x] Phase 1: 启动项目验证初始化成功
- [x] Phase 2: 实现认证功能（登录/注册）
- [-] Phase 2: 测试登录注册功能

---



---

## Phase 2 完成：认证功能

已完成：
1. API 配置
   - 创建 `src/api/request.js`（Axios 请求与响应拦截）
   - 创建 `src/api/user.js`（用户 API）
2. 状态管理
   - 创建 `src/stores/user.js`（用户状态、登录、注册）
3. 登录/注册页面
   - 创建 `src/views/auth/Login.vue`（登录）
   - 创建 `src/views/auth/Register.vue`（注册）
4. 路由
   - 更新路由配置
   - 添加登录/注册路由
   - 实现路由守卫（未登录跳转登录）
5. 页面功能
   - 表单校验
   - 错误提示
   - 加载状态
   - 自动跳转

### 功能测试

1. 未登录访问首页：
   - 访问 `http://localhost:8080/`
   - 自动跳转到登录页

2. 注册：
   - 访问 `http://localhost:8080/register`
   - 填写表单（用户名 3-50 字符，密码至少 8 位）
   - 点击“注册”
   - 成功后跳转登录

3. 登录：
   - 访问 `http://localhost:8080/login`
   - 输入用户名和密码
   - 点击“登录”
   - 成功后返回首页

### 功能说明
- 表单校验（用户名长度、密码长度、邮箱格式、密码确认）
- 错误处理与友好提示
- Token 管理（localStorage 存储、请求自动携带、过期跳转）
- 路由守卫（限制页面访问）
- UI 为 Element Plus 风格

### 当前可访问页面
- `http://localhost:8080/` - 首页（需登录）
- `http://localhost:8080/login` - 登录页
- `http://localhost:8080/register` - 注册页

请在浏览器中打开并测试。完成后可继续 Phase 3（文档管理功能）。

## 修复完成

已修复所有编译错误：

### 已修复的问题

1. 移除 `defineOptions`
2. 修正 setup() 作用域内的变量声明
3. 移除 ESLint 未使用变量警告
4. 移除不必要的 catch 子句
5. 统一组件名规范（HomePage、LoginPage、RegisterPage）

### 当前状态

项目正在 `http://localhost:8080` 运行

### 已实现功能（Phase 1 & 2）

- Phase 1: 项目初始化
- Phase 2: 认证功能

实现清单：
- Axios 请求拦截（自动添加 Token）
- 统一错误处理
- 用户登录（用户名/密码）
- 用户注册（用户名/密码/邮箱，包含确认密码）
- Token 管理（localStorage 存储）
- 路由守卫（未登录跳转）

### 页面效果

1. 访问首页 `http://localhost:8080/` → 自动跳转到登录页
2. 登录页面
   - 渐变背景
   - 用户名/密码输入
   - 表单校验
   - 链接跳转注册页
3. 注册页面
   - 用户名、密码、确认密码、邮箱
   - 校验（包括密码确认一致性）
   - 链接跳转登录页

### 下一步

- 继续实现 Phase 3：文档管理功能
  - 文档列表
  - 文档上传
  - 文档详情
  - 文档编辑
  - 文档删除

可在浏览器测试登录/注册流程。需要我继续实现 Phase 3 吗？

_**User (2025-11-09 10:34Z)**_

启动命令在哪里定义的

---

_**Assistant (default)**_



---


查看 `package.json` 中的启动命令定义：


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: package.json

---



---


启动命令定义在 `package.json` 的 `scripts` 部分。

## 启动命令定义位置

**文件**：`package.json`

**位置**：第 5-9 行的 `scripts` 部分

```json
"scripts": {
  "serve": "vue-cli-service serve",
  "build": "vue-cli-service build",
  "lint": "vue-cli-service lint"
}
```

### 命令说明

| 命令 | 实际执行 | 说明 |
|------|----------|------|
| `npm run serve` | `vue-cli-service serve` | 启动开发服务器（默认 8080 端口） |
| `npm run build` | `vue-cli-service build` | 构建生产版本 |
| `npm run lint` | `vue-cli-service lint` | 代码检查 |

### 工作原理

1. 执行 `npm run serve` 时，npm 会查找 `package.json` 中的 `scripts.serve`
2. 执行对应的命令：`vue-cli-service serve`
3. `vue-cli-service` 由 `@vue/cli-service` 包提供（在 `devDependencies` 中）

### 修改端口

如需修改端口，可在 `vue.config.js` 中配置：

```javascript
module.exports = defineConfig({
  devServer: {
    port: 8080  // 修改这里可以改变端口
  }
})
```

或者通过命令行参数：
```bash
npm run serve -- --port 3000
```

当前启动命令：`npm run serve` → 执行 `vue-cli-service serve` → 启动在 8080 端口。
